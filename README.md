Hi, I assume you're looking around to find out who I am. The answer is more obvious than you think. 

Send cease & desists to owens#1442 (otherwise, I will not take these repositories down).

I will comply with any valid request.

In your C&D, please include the following:
> ** Your company name (and proof you own or are a acting member of it) **
> ** File(s) requested to remove** (ie: I Would like file2.rbxl to be removed)
> ** Reason for file removal** (ie: The file is copyright of "Studio Name")
> ** Any contact (so that I am able to comply **

If you don't follow the requests above, I am not able to process your legal requests.

Thanks!
